# Covered call strategy

This strategy (a.k.a. \buy-write" strategy) amounts to buying stock and writing a
call option with a strike price K against the stock position. The trader's outlook on
the stock price is neutral to bullish. The covered call strategy has the same payo as
writing a put option (short/naked put).10 While maintaining the long stock position,
the trader can generate income by periodically selling OTM call options.
